# NFT-Project

In this project, I added a function called borrowAuthNFT into the NFT contract that was providedand make it publicly accessible to other people so they can read our NFT's metadata.

## Requirements

- [Flow Playground](https://play.flow.com/)
- Cadence Language

## Usage

1. Create your Contracts, Transactions and Scripts files on the [Flow Playground](https://play.flow.com/).
2. Run the CreateCollection transaction.
3. Run the MintNFT tracnsaction.
4. Run the GetID script to get the nft id for running the main script.
5. Run the MetaData Script and it will return the data from the created nft.
